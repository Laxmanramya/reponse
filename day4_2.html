        bachelor's degree in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but
        decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal.
        The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com,
        which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</p>

    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>Childhood and family</strong></p>
    <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.[5] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman),
        a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[6][7][8] but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol
        Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer who was once
        a half owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[9][10] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born
        1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[8][11] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an
        American-born Canadian,[12][13] and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[14][15] The family was
        very wealthy in Elon's youth; Errol Musk once said, "We had so much money at times we couldn't even close our
        safe".[10][16] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and
        elsewhere,[14] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[17] Musk has become
        estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could
        possibly think of, he has done."[17] He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.[12][18] Elon
        attended an Anglican Sunday school in his youth.[19]</p>
    <p>Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20.[20][21]
        He learned computer programming using a manual and, at age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he
        created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[22][23] An awkward and
        introverted child,[24] Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys
        threw him down a flight of stairs.[17][25] He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High
        School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.[26]
